Skeuos-GTK-Darkest
===

Skeuos-GTK-Darkest is a fork of the [Skeuos-GTK](https://github.com/daniruiz/skeuos-gtk) theme, created by [daniruiz](https://github.com/daniruiz/). While the original theme features a blueish dark color scheme, Skeuos-GTK-Darkest modifies it to provide greyish/blackish dark theme.
